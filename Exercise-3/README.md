# Exercise 3: Geocode and spatial joins

This week we will practice how to translate addresses into coordinates,
and how to join two vector layers based on their geometries.


- **Exercise 3 is due by Friday, 25 November 2022, end of day**

- Don’t forget to check out the [hints for this week’s
exercise](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/lesson-3/exercise-3.html#hints)

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points**.


## Notes

#### Solution code cells

You can always start working by removing this line of comment: 

```
# ADD YOUR CODE HERE
```

We are checking your solutions semi-automatically. Please use the suggested
variable names when writing your code. 

#### Non-editable code cells

Some of the code-cells are ‘non-editable’ which means that you are supposed to
run them, but you are not able to edit them. These non-editable code cells
should help you test your code while you proceed. 

#### *No* immediate feedback

This week’s exercise is more complex, and there often exists more than one way
to solve a problem. For this reason, exercise 3 is *not graded automatically*.
Use the cells marked `# NON-EDITABLE CODE CELL FOR TESTING YOUR SOLUTION` to
check whether your code works.
